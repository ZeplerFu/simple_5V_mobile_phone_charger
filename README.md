# simple_5V_mobile_phone_charger
First of all, it is a Chinese report.
This design has designed a simple 220Vac input 5Vdc output mobile phone charger through the combination of several common circuits and the use of common power electronic devices. The software is MATLAB. First, the AC with an effective value of 220V is reduced to 10V AC through a transformer, and then it is rectified through a single bridge uncontrolled rectifier circuit composed of four diodes. After rectification, it is filtered through a large capacitor. The filtered output voltage has basically stabilized DC voltage. 5V voltage is output through the step-down chopper circuit. Finally, the feedback controlled switching power supply is used to reduce the error of the output voltage, The precision is improved by adjusting the parameters of PID transfer function. Thus, the circuit design and simulation of the simple 5V mobile phone charger are completed.
